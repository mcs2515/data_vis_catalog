		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<div class='desc'>
			<p>In this domain, you will find a catalogue of different kinds of graphs where data is visually drawn to screen. Within these graphs they tell the viewer a story and show relationships between variables and or entities. There are 18 total graphs and layouts to look at in this domain. These range from Bar graphs to Chord Diagrams. You may wonder “What is a Chord diagram?” Well, this website will fill you in on what each different graph looks like and the purpose of each one. By the time you leave, my goal is that you as viewer will have at least learned one new thing about visually outputting data.</p><br />
			<p><strong>Warning: </strong>All data used in this domain are all FAKE. Don’t mind whatever each graph is trying to say about the topic of each graph. Rather, pay attention to how the data is used and communicated through visuals on this website.</p><br />

			<p><strong>Tools: </strong>The main library used to create the graphs on this website is <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a>. D3 is a JavaScript library that helps bring data to life. Throughout the use of HTML, SVG, and CSS, D3 can create interactive visuals driven by data.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.mockaroo.com/" target="_blank">Mockaroo</a> is a great website to use to create data on the fly. Mockaroo can generate data based on several of options and conditions. The generated data can then be exported as files such as CSV, Excel, JSON and XML files.</p>
			<p>Other tools were from websites such as <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic" target="_blank">Github: d3 Scale Chromatic</a> and <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/" target="_blank">ColorBrewer</a>. These websites help with choosing the best sets of colors to use on each graph. </p><br />

			<p><strong>References: </strong>Most descriptions of each graph come from web places such as <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/" target="_blank">DataVizCatalogue</a> and Github. These are great places to get more details about a certain chart. </p>

			<p>Another reference is from a book called Interactive Data Visualization for the Web written by Scott Murray. In this book, Murray gives brief descriptions of a handful of graphs and dives into how to create each one with D3. It’s an entertaining book to read about coding with D3.</p>
